Commands to install Kivy

python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools virtualenv 

 python -m virtualenv kvenv

 kvenv\Scripts\activate

 python -m pip install kivy[full]

 install other needed libraries such as object recognition

 text to voice for android and IOS, pip install plyer

 after everything is installed open Obkivy.py
    and obkiv.kv 

    the py file manages and runs the software
    the .kv file is more like the CSS for the GUI
